This app allows you to search by some hashtag, and it returns, images and descriptions from different social media

On current version we only support instagram and twitter.

 - Import libraries and stuff (no clue on how
   :p)

Then, you can just API call it doing a

    > GET http://localhost:8080/search/[YOUR SEARCH]

for example `http://localhost:8080/search/pokemon`
